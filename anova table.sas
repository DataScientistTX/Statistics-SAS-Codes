The output in SAS includes an ANOVA table.  The regression sums of squares are called the model
sums of squares in SAS.  


For simple linear regression, the model F statistic is the same as the F statistic testing 
if the Beta corresponding to X (here Lotsize) is 0.

In general, the model F statistic tests if all the predictors are 0.  Since we only have one predictor,
for now these tests are equivalent.

Note, we have that  t = 10.29 and F = 105.88=10.29^2
